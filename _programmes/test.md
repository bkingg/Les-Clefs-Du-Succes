### A Web Of Words[![Link](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/images/link.svg)](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/11/the-perfect-paragraph/#a-web-of-words)

In 1992, Tim Berners-Lee circulated a document titled “[HTML Tags](http://www.w3.org/History/19921103-hypertext/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/Tags.html),” which outlined just 20 tags, many of which are now obsolete or have taken other forms. The first surviving tag to be defined in the document, after the crucial anchor tag, is the paragraph tag. It wasn’t until 1993 that a [discussion emerged](http://1997.webhistory.org/www.lists/www-talk.1993q1/0182.html) on the proposed image tag.

Bursting with imagery, motion, interaction and distraction though it is, today’s World Wide Web is still primarily a conduit for textual information. In HTML5, the **focus on writing and authorship** is more pronounced than ever. It’s evident in the very way that new elements such as `article`and `aside` are named. HTML5 asks us to treat the HTML document more as… well, a document.
